# ## Todo
# - ~~subtracting formula~~
# - ~~1bitgc without deg(v) in the denominator~~
# - ~~Look more closely at the error bound and try to justify the independence of the error to the number of nodes~~
# - Look for other differentially private mechanisms for mean/summation estimation and try to make them work for the
#       graph convolution if they are working better than 1BitMean.
# - ~~Perform experiments over some more datasets, preferably not citation networks~~
# - Perform experiments for the link prediction task
# - Assess the robustness of the method to the sparsity level of the graph
# - Visualize the embeddings obtained privately and compare with the results with the original GCN
# - ~~Report the class label distribution for the node classification task~~
# - Run the experiments for a wider range of epsilon
# - ~~Error in the estimation of the graph convolution as a function of epsilon and node degree~~
# - Shallow node embedding baselines
# - Experiment for combination of private/non-private features
