## Todo
- ~~subtracting formula~~
- ~~1bitgc without deg(v) in the denominator~~
- ~~Look more closely at the error bound and try to justify the independence of the error to the number of nodes~~
- ~~Perform experiments for the link prediction task~~
- ~~Report the class label distribution for the node classification task~~
- ~~Error in the estimation of the graph convolution as a function of epsilon and node degree~~
- ~~Shallow node embedding baselines~~
- ~~Run the experiments for a wider range of epsilon~~
- ~~Experiment for combination of private/non-private features~~
- Perform experiments over some more datasets, preferably not citation networks
- Visualize the embeddings obtained privately and compare with the results with the original GCN
- Adapt other differentially private mechanisms for mean/summation estimation
- Generalize beyond GCNs
- Convergence of different models
- Experiment on the percentage of nodes with private features
