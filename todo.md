## Todo
- ~~subtracting formula~~
- ~~1bitgc without deg(v) in the denominator~~
- ~~Look more closely at the error bound and try to justify the independence of the error to the number of nodes~~
- ~~Perform experiments for the link prediction task~~
- ~~Report the class label distribution for the node classification task~~
- ~~Error in the estimation of the graph convolution as a function of epsilon and node degree~~
- ~~Shallow node embedding baselines~~
- ~~Run the experiments for a wider range of epsilon~~
- ~~Experiment for combination of private/non-private features~~
- ~~Perform experiments over some more datasets, preferably not citation networks~~
- ~~Visualize the embeddings obtained privately and compare with the results with the original GCN~~
- ~~Experiment on the percentage of nodes with private features~~
- ~~Replace GCN by VGAE for link prediction~~
- ~~Fine-tuning models to get best results~~
- ~~Implement Laplace mechanism as DP baseline~~
- ~~Bring back legacy one-bit~~
- ~~Adapt other differentially private mechanisms for mean/summation estimation~~
- ~~Measure the gain over gcn+raw in varying pfr and pnr~~
- Limit training nodes with degree greater than a threshold
- Multi-dimensional 1bit mechanism
- Combination of mechanisms based on variance 
- Fine tune gcn+bit and gcn+lap for eps=1
- Generalize beyond GCNs
- Private Labels
